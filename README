  *.dia			DIA schemas for development purposes
compile-sql.sh		Script to compile all DIA schemas into a single SQL file

Getting started
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1) compile-sql.sh
Change directory to where this file is located and execute it as:
./compile-sql.sh mysql
It will output a file called 'GLUE20-mysql.schema' which is a compilation of all
DIA schemas under the DIA/ directory translated into SQL for the MySQL MyISAM.
If the file 'GLUE20-mysql.sql' already exists, it will copy it
into 'GLUE20-mysql.sql.bak'.

NOTE: If the default values do not fit your needs, feel free to edit the script
and change them. It is easy to do! :)
